Hi Humans and Github-ers!

Richard is here!  I like developing websites using python programming language with django framework because that's what I have learned after schooling.  I really wanted to pursue web developing because it is my hobby now even if my work is not inline with my hobby.  I hope you could help through my developing stages. Thank you!
